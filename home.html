<p>BrowserCraft is a 2D recreation of the popular game MineCraft by   Mojang. I am hoping that this will be able to reach a level better than   other MineCraft clones and such as popular 2D clone Terraria. </p>
<p>I am not trying to re-invent the wheel since there is already   another 2D recreation (Terraria). But I am hoping that BrowserCraft will   push the frontiers of browser gameplay. Especially with games such as   MineCraft. </p>
<p>I am also hoping to get as many features available in the   original MineCraft into BrowserCraft as possible. This means all the   mobs, their intelligence and all the physics available in MineCraft.</p>
<p>The map renderer currently renders a single chunk. A world chunk is a 5x16 playable area. <br/>
  (Currently,   there is only one playable chunk). </p>
