BrowserCraft is a 2D recreation of the popular game MineCraft by Mojang. I am hoping that this will be able to reach a level better than other MineCraft clones and such as popular 2D clone Terraria.

I am not trying to re-invent the wheel since there is already another 2D recreation (Terraria). But I am hoping that BrowserCraft will push the frontiers of browser gameplay. Especially with games such as MineCraft.

I am also hoping to get as many features available in the original MineCraft into BrowserCraft as possible. This means all the mobs, their intelligence and all the physics available in MineCraft.

Currently, I have already set up a map renderer (Manual Map-Making) to render a world chunk. A world chunk is a 5x16 playable area. (Currently, there is only one playable chunk and the chunk loading code hasn't been written).

There are only 6 playable blocks so far:
Stone
Cobblestone
Grass
Dirt
Plank
Brick


Basic block breaking has been setup(A single click breaks any block).

Block placing has not been setup is working 
Note: Selected Block will show in the Title Bar. This will be changed.

Basic player movement works but still very buggy.

I need all the help I can get to make this a success. So please, consider this as my humble invitation to join in on developing BrowserCraft.
